I'm currently developing a first-person 3D survival game in Unity.
While it's not finished yet, it incorporates a range of features, including player status, menu and saving functionality, animation, inventory management, tree cutting, rock mining, item collection and crafting, as well as construction.
You can observe the progress in the images and review the code.
